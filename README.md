# webroll
Stop searching YouTube for a rickroll with a different URL!

Now you can create your own custom site and rickroll your friends with ease. 

You can use these files in many ways: 

On your Local Network:

On your machine: open the files directly

On other devices in your network: Host the files with ``python3 -m http.server`` or ``php -S localhost:8000``
 
You must have [Python 3](https://python.org/downloads) or [PHP](https:/php.net/download.php) installed on your machine.

Exposing your IP: 

You can expose your IP with ``python3 -m http.server *port*`` and opening *port* on your router

Or by using tools like ngrok: https://ngrok.com/

But if you don't want to expose your IP, you can get a Linux server on Linode: https://www.linode.com/
